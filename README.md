# Tower Bridge AR

Augmented reality application made using Blender (for bridge model and textures) and Unity with Vuforia (for AR application). This application will use the phone camera to recognize a selected image marker and project a 3D model above the marker on the screen. The model also contains three interactable (clickable) points of interest (POIs).
